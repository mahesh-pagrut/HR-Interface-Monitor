# 💼 HR Interface Monitoring Dashboard

## 📌 Introduction

This project is a web-based **Interface Monitoring Dashboard** built for HR integrations. It helps monitor the health and history of data flows between systems like **SAP SuccessFactors** and downstream platforms (e.g., SAP ECP or third-party apps). 

The goal is to provide a **clear, user-friendly interface** for tracking interface statuses, filtering logs, and visualizing trends.
